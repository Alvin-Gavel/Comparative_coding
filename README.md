For my new job at Karolinska Institutet, I will have to pick up a couple of different programming languages. This repository consists of exercises where I pick some very simple problem and then try to solve it in Python, R, PHP and bash. I try to stick to language constructs that have some fairly close equivalent in the other languages. That means that there is often some more efficient technique that could be used instead.
